                <p>A top down roguelike game, taking place in a multi-dimensional never ending train, that I worked on as designer and programmer with a dedicated team of 9 for a contract to one of our 
                        professors. We all communicated in person, over Discord, and via Jira and updated the project via branches and pull requests on Github.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Designed and programmed key gameplay systems, including UI, inventory, 
                    character stats, and movement mechanics, contributing to overall player experience. </li>
                <li>Asissted with documentation and code cleanup</li>
                <li>Collaborated using GitHub, Jira, and in-person/online meetings</li>

                <p>A survival horror game in Unreal Engine focused on escaping waves of monsters while managing hunger and health.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>A student group project that lasted a semester that I worked on as main UI designer and programmer, as well as helping with general design and programming. 
                    I did all of the design and coding of the menus and UI in this game.</li>
                <li>When designing the UI, I made sure to try and keep it subtle and out of the way, so that it did not take the player out of the game.
                        This would allow the player to keep their tension high while playing, as bars or a more intrusive system for health and hunger would be more likely 
                        to take them out of it. </li>
                <li>I also tried to make it match the horror theme by making it visually dark and brooding.</li>
                <li>Contributed to scripting and team sprint goals using Jira and GitHub</li>

                <p>A procedural platformer where I developed randomized obstacle systems for replayability and challenge with a team.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>A student group project that I worked on as designer and programmer with a small team. We all communicated both in person and over 
                    Discord, and updated the project via branches and pull requests on Github.</li>
                    
                <li>Together, we worked on making a game where a tower would be generated with random rooms you had to jump up through. I was in charge of 
                                designing obstacles and extra platforming challenges. I worked on a system where platforming challenges that functioned similarly 
                                (ie three platforms in the form of stairs, or one moving platform that went up diagonally in random speeds) would be randomly selected 
                                from arrays in spawners that were hand placed in locations in the generated rooms. </li>

                <li>As the rooms themselves were made by hand, and were just randomly selected from, the obstacles and platforms that I made worked to add an element 
                    of replayability to the game, as you could go through the same room twice, but the platforms would be different. Care was taken to make sure 
                    all platforms would not cut off all possible progression, were appropriate sizes to allow easy access, and that the 
                    moving ones were not too fast to get on top of.</li>
